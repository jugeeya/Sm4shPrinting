# Sm4shPrinting
A python3 script that allows printing of simple string effects in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U.

## Running the script
Passing a string argument will output code that will work in FITX or Sm4shCommand by copy and paste.
```bash
python3 printSm4shString.py "hello"
```

## Contents of the string
Please note that after 50 or so segments (so around 12-15 characters), the game will cease to render some of the characters. Also, "\n" can be used in the string to force a newline.
